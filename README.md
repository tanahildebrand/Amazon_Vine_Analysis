# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The Amazon Vine program is a paid service to generate product reviews. I analyzed a dataset specific to Grocery products, provided by Amazon, which includes data for both paid (Vine) and non-paid reviews. Using PySpark I completed the ETL process, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the data into pgAdmin. I then analyzed the data to determine if there is bias toward favorable reviews if the review was part of the Vine program.

## Results
  1) How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  2) How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  3) What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
